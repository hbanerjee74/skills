# Review Flow

## Code Review

Spawn `feature-dev:code-reviewer` with: worktree path, branch name, summary of changes.

## Fix Cycle

- **High/medium severity** → must fix
- **Low severity** → fix if straightforward, otherwise note

Spawn fix agents (parallel if touching different areas). **Max 2 review cycles** — then proceed with remaining low-severity notes.

## Completion Criteria

Before moving to Review on Linear, all of these must be true:
- No outstanding high-severity issues
- PR created and linked
- Linear issue updated with final notes

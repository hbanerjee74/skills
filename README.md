# Skills

Built with [Skill Builder](https://github.com/hbanerjee/skill-builder).

## Structure

Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md          # Main skill prompt
    references/       # Supporting reference files
    context/          # Research & decision artifacts
```

## Usage

Import a `.skill` file into Skill Builder or copy a skill directory into your Claude Code project.

# Silver/Gold Layer Design

## Focus
Examine data flow from source to consumption to determine where the silver/gold boundary falls -- whether silver should be source-conformed or business-conformed, and what that implies for lineage and debugging. Evaluate physical vs. logical conformed dimensions, considering pattern choices (e.g., Type 2 makes views expensive). Identify which aggregate tables the domain's primary query patterns require.

## Delta Principle
Claude knows medallion architecture and star schema. The delta is where to draw the silver/gold boundary, physical vs. logical conformance, and materialization trade-offs specific to pattern choices. A skill that misplaces the silver/gold boundary produces a layer structure where business logic leaks into silver or raw complexity is exposed in gold, degrading both debuggability and usability.

## Coverage Targets
Research should surface: silver/gold boundary placement, physical vs. logical conformed dimension governance, materialization strategy trade-offs, and aggregate table needs. Focus on decisions that change skill content.

## Questions to Research
1. Where should the silver/gold boundary fall for this domain — should silver be source-conformed (structural cleaning only) or business-conformed (includes business logic), and what drives that choice?
2. Which conformed dimensions should be physically materialized tables vs. logical views, and how do the domain's historization pattern choices affect that decision?
3. For Type 2 dimensions specifically, what are the materialization implications of view-based conformance at the query volumes this domain generates?
4. Which fact tables require pre-aggregated summary tables or materialized rollups to support the primary query workload, and at what grain?
5. How should cross-domain conformed dimensions be governed — who owns them, how are schema changes coordinated, and how are conflicts between domain-specific needs resolved?
6. What lineage and debugging requirements constrain the layer design — are there compliance or incident-resolution needs that require preserving intermediate states?
7. Are there aggregate patterns (e.g., period-over-period rollups, running totals, cohort aggregates) that cannot be efficiently computed at query time and require pre-materialization?

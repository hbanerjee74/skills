# Record Lifecycle & State

## Focus
Map which objects follow defined state machines and what the valid transitions are. Look for lifecycle boundary violations (regression, stage skipping, reopening closed records), record type-specific lifecycle paths diverging from defaults, and state fields that should be correlated but can be independently edited. Investigate how actual production lifecycle deviates from designed lifecycle.

## Delta Principle
The "State Machine and Lifecycle" template section previously had zero researching dimensions assigned to it. RecordTypeId filtering, ForecastCategory/StageName independence, and custom stage progressions are lifecycle behaviors Claude does not reliably flag. Without explicit lifecycle research, the skill omits state-dependent filtering logic and mismodels transitions.

## Coverage Targets
Research should surface: state machine behaviors, custom stage progressions, lifecycle boundary conditions (regression, stage skipping), and record type-specific lifecycle variations. Focus on decisions that change skill content.

## Questions to Research
1. Which objects in this domain follow defined state machines, and what are the valid state transitions — including which transitions are reversible?
2. Can records regress to earlier stages, skip stages, or be reopened after reaching a terminal state — and how frequently does this happen in production?
3. Which record types have lifecycle paths that diverge from the default lifecycle, and how do RecordTypeId-specific filters affect which records should be included in each stage?
4. Which state fields appear to be correlated but can actually be independently edited (e.g., stage and forecast category can diverge), and which value takes precedence for each use case?
5. What custom stage progressions exist beyond the platform's standard stages, and how should they be mapped to standard reporting categories?
6. Are there automated state transitions (triggers, workflows, process builders) that can move records without user action, and how do they affect CDC change detection?
7. How does the actual lifecycle in production deviate from the documented or designed lifecycle — which edge cases are common enough to require handling in the data model?

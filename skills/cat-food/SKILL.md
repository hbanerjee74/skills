# Mock Skill

Build well-structured applications following established patterns for error handling, testing, and deployment.

## Quick Start

When starting a new feature:
1. Check the architecture decision records in `docs/adr/`
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Implement with the patterns below
4. Add tests following the tiered strategy
5. Submit for review

## Core Patterns

### Error Handling
Use result types for expected errors. Every error should have:
- **Detection**: How to identify the error
- **Impact**: What breaks downstream
- **Recovery**: Specific steps to fix
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future

```typescript
type Result<T, E = Error> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E };
```

### Testing Strategy
Follow the test pyramid:
- **Unit tests** (70%): Business logic, pure functions, state transitions
- **Integration tests** (20%): API contracts, database queries, service interactions
- **E2E tests** (10%): Critical user flows only (login, checkout, data export)

### Performance Thresholds
- Response time p95: < 200ms
- Throughput: > 1000 req/s
- Error rate: < 0.1%
- When thresholds are exceeded, follow the optimization sequence in `references/implementation-guide.md`

## When to Read References

- **implementation-guide.md**: Detailed patterns for error handling, logging, and deployment. Read when implementing a new service or debugging production issues.

# Research Clarifications

## Section 1: Core Concepts
1. **What is the primary use case for this skill?**
   - Recommendation: Focus on the most common workflow patterns that engineers encounter daily.

2. **What level of expertise should this skill assume?**
   - Recommendation: Intermediate — familiar with basic concepts but needs guidance on best practices and edge cases.

3. **Should this skill cover both greenfield and brownfield scenarios?**
   - Recommendation: Yes, with emphasis on greenfield but include migration guidance for existing systems.

## Section 2: Architecture & Design
4. **What architectural patterns should be prioritized?**
   - Recommendation: Start with the most widely adopted patterns, then layer in alternatives for specific constraints.

5. **How should the skill handle technology-specific vs technology-agnostic guidance?**
   - Recommendation: Lead with technology-agnostic principles, then provide concrete examples for the most common tools.

6. **Should performance optimization be covered in the main skill or references?**
   - Recommendation: Cover key performance principles in SKILL.md, detailed optimization in references.

## Section 3: Implementation Details
7. **What level of code examples should be included?**
   - Recommendation: Include copy-paste-ready templates for the most common patterns.

8. **Should testing guidance be included?**
   - Recommendation: Yes, include a testing strategy section with concrete patterns.

9. **How should error handling be addressed?**
   - Recommendation: Cover common failure modes with specific recovery patterns.
